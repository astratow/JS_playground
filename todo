Basic window unit with one bar.

#Maths
barSize = height - 27; // 12mm for frame, 1.5mm for a key that goes into the bar 12 +1.5 = 13.5, there is to sides so *2 = 27

This is more complicated, but not the most complicated.
bar is 18mm thick (usualy, there are different types, but we will start on this one)

#Maths
horizontalBar = width - 27 - 18; (18mm is a barThickness, I put it separatelly to make a point of reference)
verticalBar = height - 27 - 18;
